## Brainstorming Ideas:

Setting up this repository I felt like would be a better way to get started. This Repo will just focus on us brainstorming Ideas on what out project would look like.

### Objective

- We have to build a CLI Project together following the same requirements as noted here: [CLI PROJECT REPO](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cli-data-gem-assessment)


### Ideas

Because this is a CLI it is limits what we could do when it comes to external processes. Like front end and UI. The Project should stick true to its goal and truely be a terminal based process. 

**Few Ideas:** 
- Create something that we could use for a daily stand up game. Potential Resource [Phil's Mod One Final Project](https://github.com/rothberry/module-one-final-project-guidelines-chicago-web-062420)

- Work with the resistance? [Resistance Website](http://www.theresistanceplus.com/)
